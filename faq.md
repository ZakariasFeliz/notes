## Important
* Whenever you are doing a "Clone this" project - use only  assets you create yourself or that have copyrights which would allow you to use them.
* Develop the habit of giving attribution for everything you use that was the product of someone else's effort.

## When you're building a Project
### Use each project to demonstrate that you can deliver an optimized product and include:
  * a build process to minimize assets (like [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/)),
  * at least 5 automated tests ([Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io/1.0/index.html), [mocha](https://mochajs.org/), sinon, chai, jasmine, tape, whatever works for you),
  * use a linter (like [ESLint](http://eslint.org/)) on your JavaScript and
  * have some method to your madness when it comes to your css naming conventions (like [BEM](http://getbem.com/introduction/))
  * a README.md file that clearly explains the project, and
  * practice using [meaningful commit messages](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)

* As you learn, take the time to discuss what you're learning with others:
  * write blog posts,
  * spend time actively discussing code and concepts with other developers (of varying skill levels),
  * if you're comfortable with it - produce some helpful videos explaining topics that others might find daunting, and (most importantly) embrace the opportunity to help others one on one.

**Important:** You never know something so thoroughly as when you take the time to deeply consider it and explain it to someone else who might be struggling. Helping others doesn't just benefit them, it benefits you by increasing your understanding and mastery of the topic. Help people - you'll learn a lot in the process - you'll be a better developer for having done it.

## Power up your learning - make every minute count
* When you're working through a book, type out the example code and do all the exercises.
* When you're working through a course, do all the assignments.

### For each item you should:
* take notes, on a blog, in markdown, wherever, somewhere - not about what you read, or about what the instructor said - about what you learned
* build something - even if it's just a 20 line function that computes something you find interesting
* if you build something, document it and test it as appropriate
* do the exercises, build the projects - fully, not some scaled down halfassery
### For four projects of your choosing
* Seek 1-3 other developers to collaborate on the project
* Coordinate with the team to complete the project
* Build the project out to a full production quality application
* Invite others who are not associated with the team to rigorously test the final product.
* Resolve any legitimate issues found
### Once per month - do two or more of the following:
* Write up a comprehensive blog post or markdown entry in a repository detailing the high points of what you learned that month
* Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NIb9l3imAo) and [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eg5-tdAwclo) - on interviewing
* Read [this](http://steve-yegge.blogspot.co.uk/2007_09_01_archive.html) - on crafting a resume
* Do one lesson from [CUST104: Business Communications](https://learn.saylor.org/course/view.php?id=345)
* Live stream what you're working on for an hour. Or, lend a hand to someone who needs help by screensharing and walking them through it.
* Catch up on industry reading on sites like [Joel on Software](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/), [Coding Horror](https://blog.codinghorror.com/), [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/), [A List Apart](http://alistapart.com/articles), [UX Myths](http://uxmyths.com/), [JavaScript Weekly](http://javascriptweekly.com/)
## Do you have any hints for success?
* have git commits every week, most of the days of the week
* try to get in one of [@tropicalchancer's cohorts](https://chingu-cohorts.github.io/chingu-directory/) - be active once you're in
* try to pick one to two other languages to use regularly for solving algorithms and implementing projects in addition to JavaScript (good choices would be to pick one of C++, Java or Python and one of Golang or Rust).
* spend 30 minutes a day studying math on Khan Academy
## What should I be studying alongside the guides?
There WILL be math. And, it's important. If the thought frightens you, or bores you, or has you thinking
"this isn't for me", head to [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/) right now, sign up, and start devoting 30 minutes a day. This is an investment that will pay off. I'm not making this up.

## I'm stuck, what should I do?
* Use the official docs.
* Use MDN
* Train yourself to write the code, not copy paste it.
* Stack overflow should be a resource for ideas, not a crutch to help you avoid writing code yourself.
* [Shay Howe](http://learn.shayhowe.com/) has a good overview of HTML and CSS if you need more than you got in the CS50 and MEAN stack course to feel comfortable with the projects.
* If you're at a loss for how to figure out the design for a page you're building, reference [Google's Material Design documentation](https://material.google.com/). Try to become familar with it by the time you finish the list of resources in this post. It will save you from having shoddy looking pages.

## How do I deploy a frontend project
Here are some resources to help you learn how to use surge.sh, you could also use GitHub Pages or any
other host you want, but figuring that out is up to you.
- [YouTube video by Hiáº¿u Sensei walking through the entire process](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W10ckhQ1H7c)
- [YouTube video by David Wells that goes into far more detail](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZA8QVLOinE)
- [Very brief article and video showing how to quickly deploy to surge.sh](http://toolsfortheweb.net/hosting/using-surge-for-free-static-site-hosting/)
- [surge.sh site](https://surge.sh/)
## What sites should I have bookmarked and reference frequently?
* [surge.sh](https://surge.sh/) - deploy your frontend projects here (or use github pages)
* [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - look HTML, CSS, and JavaScript stuff up here
* [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/) - deploy your fullstack projects here (or glitch)
* [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) or [mLab](https://mlab.com/) - database hosting
* [GitHub](https://github.com/) - store your code here
* [Material Design](https://material.google.com) - lean on this when you need a structure for creating a minimalistic but awesome looking site
* [Material Palette](https://www.materialpalette.com/) - for selecting color schemes
* [Wirify](https://www.wirify.com/) - for quickly turning a web page into a wireframe so you can see the big picture instead of all the graphics

## Are there any additional free resources you'd recommend alongside the materials in the guides?
[OpenStax](https://openstax.org/subjects) - Open Source textbooks on a variety of University level topics, check here if you want a reference math or physics textbook
